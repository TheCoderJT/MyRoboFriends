### RoboFriends ZMT Project React + Redux Version

This project is part of the Zero To Mastry Course, This is the version were the instructor teaches redux. My main branch is the normal react project without redux and only using the state that is built in with react.

To be honest redux is a bit messy and personally prefer the normal way of controlling state. But, maybe if i continue learning redux it may grow on me.
